=====================================

Written by Julia Chun (hyojchun)

Project Results

### Resulting Image

A published demo can be found here : https://hjchun96.github.io/hw01-noisy-terrain/
   
Below is the final image generated by the code:

![](example.png)

It roughly represents a scene with grassy ground, trees, and waterfalls. 

### Noise Functions

FBM:

Voronoi:

FBM + Voronoi: 


### GUI Features

Daylight Amount: The user can select the amount of daylight the scene receives, between Low, Medium, and High, which accordingly modifies 'ambientTerm' in fragment shaders.

Water Flow Speed Control: The user can change the speed the water flows from the waterfall, and the inverse of this term is multiplied to the time term that varys colors along the y axis.
