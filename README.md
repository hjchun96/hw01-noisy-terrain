Project Results

### Resulting Image

A published demo can be found here : 

The `README.md` should start with a title, followed by your name (with a link to your website, twitter, blog, etc. with your contact info), and then a representative image of your work.  Including an image like this has been tradition in SIGGRAPH and many other graphics venues for years.  Here's some good examples:

   * [GPU-Accelerated Dynamic Fracture in the Browser](https://github.com/kainino0x/cis565final) by Jiatong He and Kai Ninomiya
   * [Surface Mesh Reconstruction from RGBD Images](https://github.com/cboots/RGBD-to-Mesh) by Collin Boots and Dalton Banks
   * [Accelerated Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping on the GPU](https://github.com/ishaan13/PhotonMapper) by Ishaan Singh, Yingting Xiao, and Xiaoyan Zhu
   
Here's the photon mapping image:

The image should be representative in that it highlights the breadth and depth of your work.  It should be your favorite showpiece.  Make sure the resolution is reasonable so it downloads quickly.  Do not use `bmp` files; use `png` or `jpg`.

### Noise Functions

### GUI Features

#### Animated gifs

Animated gifs were hot in the 1990's and they have made a come back!  Since we can't embed YouTube videos in markdown, another alternative is to create an animated gif using [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/), which is very easy to use.  Here's an example from [Baking Ambient Occlusion in the glTF Pipeline](http://cesiumjs.org/2016/08/08/ambient-occlusion/):
