### Resulting Image

A published demo can be found here : https://hjchun96.github.io/hw01-noisy-terrain/
   
Below is the final image generated by the code:

![](Images/example.png)

It roughly represents a scene with grassy ground, trees, and waterfalls. 

### Noise Functions

Voronoi: Voronoi noise is applied in changing the height of the terrain, which is designed after a waterfall.

FBM: FBM noise is applied to vary the waterfall color along the x and y direction. The color movements are time controlled such that they flow along the y axis with a speed that is a function of time.

FBM + Voronoi: Voronoi is first used with the seed same as the one used for terrain height calculation and coordintes with zero or negative heights are passed through FBM so that they have tree-like spikes. The trees are colored brown.


### GUI Features

Daylight Amount: The user can select the amount of daylight the scene receives, between Low, Medium, and High, which accordingly modifies 'ambientTerm' in fragment shaders.


Low Light   				 |  Medium Light     			| High Light     		 |
:-------------------:|:----------------------:|:-------------------:

Water Flow Speed Control: The user can change the speed the water flows from the waterfall, and the inverse of this term is multiplied to the time term that varys colors along the y axis.
